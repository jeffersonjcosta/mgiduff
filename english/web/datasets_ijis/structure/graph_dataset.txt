g | graph id
v | id | code of discipline | period of discipline
e | id of the source vertex | code of source discipline (prerequisite) | id of the target vertex | code of source discipline | cost

WHERE: 

The lines with 'g' letter indicates the beginning of a new graph. For graphs of the curriculum, the graph id is the id of the curriculum. In the case of school history, the graph if is formed by the id of the student plus the id of the curriculum that he attended;

The lines that start with the letter 'v' represents the vertices of the graph, and are composed of a numeric id, by the discipline code and the period of this discipline;

The lines with the letter 'e' represents the edges of the graph. An edge is represented as follows: the letter 'e', indicating the start of an edge; by the id of the vertex of origin; the source discipline code (prerequisite), the same code that appears in the curriculum of the course and historical students; the id of the target vertex; the code of discipline of origin; and, finally, by cost of the edge. This weight is always one (1) in the graph of curricula and in the case of graphs of historical students, this cost is the amount of time the student attended the edge.
